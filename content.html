<p>In Python the <code>print</code> function is used to display output. This can be useful for reporting results to the user or debugging code. To use it, write the word <code>print</code> followed by parentheses containing the values you wish to print, such as in the example below:</p>

<py-cell>
print(42)
</py-cell>

<p>You can also provide multiple values to the <code>print</code> function by separating them with commas. The values will be printed with a space in between them by default:</p>

<py-cell>
print(999, 42)
</py-cell>

<p>By default, the <code>print</code> function adds a newline character at the end of the output, which means that subsequent print statements will appear on a new line:</p>

<py-cell>
print(10)
print(9)
</py-cell>
